# Breaking Down The Problem

When we have a complicated problem that we want to solve with machine learning, the first step is to break down the problem into a sequence for simple tasks. Then, using our breakdown as a guide, we can pull different tools from our machine learning toolbox to solve each of the smaller tasks. By chaining together several small solutions into a pipeline, we’ll have a system that can do something complicated.


# Input:Webcamera for Video  -->  Detect Chair or Table --> Detect Human --> Compute Iou--> Show Parking Space

# Detect the table in restaurant
